## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a command line program that would dynamically generate a standard README.md file based on user inputs. The two Javascript libraries used to achieve this were inquirer and fs. By utilizing Javascript alone a quick file generator was able to be created that utilized new concepts like command line user interaction and file creation. I learned how to effectively use template literals to make a simple user experience. The thing I am most proud of with this project was that I originally had the ability for multiple licenses to be selected and badges to be shown; however, I determined that only one was likely better and that in the future I would be able to apply that same logic to apply multiple other badges. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user story and acceptance criteria.
